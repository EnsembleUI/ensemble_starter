## Getting Started

This starter project enables you to load Ensemble-powered App. It also includes examples on how
to integrate Ensemble pages into your existing App.

Ensemble definitions can be loaded locally (by default) or remotely via Ensemble-hosted definition. Change your configuration via `ensemble-config.yaml`

### Run
#### If you intend to use Ensemble to power your entire App:
- Update the page name you want to load initially-
- Run `main.dart`

#### To use Ensemble pages with your existing Flutter App:
- Run `example_existing_app_*` to see some simple guides.
